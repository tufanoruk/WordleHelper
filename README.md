# WordleHelper
Helps you to play wordle game. 

Curently for Turkish. But if you can provide list of words for your language, most probobly it will work.

This is by no means complete or bug free program. (misaligned and non-uniq letter handling need fixing)

This is just to feed for my enthusiasm to apply new AI course search algorithm to a game that I frequently play.

```shell
Usage: 
% python3 ./wordlehelp.py <file contains 5 letter words> <initial guess>
```
