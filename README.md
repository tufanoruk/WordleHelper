# WordleHelper

Helps you to play wordle game.

Curently for Turkish. But if you can provide list of words for your language, most probably it will work.

This is by no means complete or bug free program. Error handling needs to be fixed.

This is just to feed for my enthusiasm to apply new AI course search algorithm to a game that I frequently play.

```shell
Usage: 
% python3 ./wordlehelp.py <file contains 5 letter words> <initial guess>
```
